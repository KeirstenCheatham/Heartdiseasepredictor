# Heartdiseasepredictor
Goals of the project:  
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient attributes and medical measurements. To achieve this, I will utilize the heart disease dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and build a web application using Python Flask. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques, the project aims to create a predictive model that can assist in early detection and intervention for individuals at risk of heart disease. The web application will provide a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient information and obtain predictions regarding heart disease presence.
Data Description: 
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository  and is titled "Heart Disease Data Set."

The Heart Disease dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine  Learning Repository. The Heart Disease database contains a total of 76 attributes.  However, in published studies, researchers have primarily focused on a specific subset  of 14 attributes labeled as 'process.cleveland.data'. These 14 attributes are related to  heart health, risk factors, and diagnostic indicators, they include: age, sex, chest pain  type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting  electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina,  ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST  segment, the number of major vessels, and Thalassemia. The dataset consists of 303  observations, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart  disease. Descriptive statistics will be computed to gain insights into the dataset's  characteristics. The data was collected by institutions such as the Hungarian Institute of  Cardiology and the V.A. Medical Center. 

Software and applications: 
Python will be used as the primary programming language for this project. The software stack will include libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning modeling, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization. Additionally, I will use Flask, a Python web framework, to build a web application that will serve as the interface for the heart disease prediction model. The web application will allow healthcare professionals to input patient attributes and receive predictions regarding heart disease presence.

Analysis plan & Model Specifications: 
1. Data preprocessing: Perform data cleaning tasks, handle missing values, handle  categorical variables, perform feature scaling, handle any imbalance, and check for outliers.
2. Feature selection and engineering: Identify the most relevant features for heart  disease prediction based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis. Create  new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power. 
3. Model selection and evaluation: Train and evaluate different machine learning  models suitable for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, support  vector machines, random forest, or gradient boosting classifiers. Utilize  appropriate evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,  and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), to  assess model performance. 
4. Model optimization: Fine-tune the selected model by adjusting hyperparameters  using techniques like grid search or random search. Apply techniques such as  cross-validation to mitigate overfitting and ensure robustness. 
5. Web application set up: Set up flask, design the user interface, integrate machine learning model into flask application, predict functionality, deploy.
